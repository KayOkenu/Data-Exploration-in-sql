Data Exploration In SQL Project using Covid Death and Covid Vaccinations datasets.

This repository contains codes and data for a data exploration project to describe the dataset characterizations, properies and accuracy, in order to better understand the nature of the data.

Highlights: Advanced SQL techniques such as Case statements, TempTables, Conversion of data types, Joins and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were utilized in the exploration of the dataset.

This project contains code to:
1. Standardize data formats
2. Analyze and ascertain:
--Total death rates
--Rates of infection
--Percentage of the infection by countries
--Global death percentage
--Percentage of deaths by countries and continents
--The number of people vaccinated day by day.
Files: The following files are included in this repository:
1. SQL script containing code for exploring and analyzing two datasets.
2. Link to the raw datasets.
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to explore these files to gain a better understanding of the project.
